# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately and do not open a public GitHub issue.

- Preferred: GitHub Security Advisories (Security tab: "Report a vulnerability")
- Email: `support@qryptcoin.org` (include “SECURITY” in the subject)

Include as much detail as possible:

- Affected component(s) and versions/commit hash
- Steps to reproduce or a minimal demonstration
- Impact assessment (e.g., fund loss, RCE, DoS)
- Any suggested fix or mitigation

## Scope / Supported Versions

Security fixes are tracked on the `main` branch. Tagged releases (when published) are supported according to their release notes.
